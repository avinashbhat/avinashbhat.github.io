Quality emerges through collaboration rather than existing in isolation. While quality might seem purely subjective at first glance---what constitutes "higher quality" varies between individuals---this view oversimplifies how quality actually functions in practice.

The apparent contradiction between subjective quality and objective standards resolves when we consider three key insights:

**The collaborative process itself creates meaning.** The value lies not just in the standards we agree upon, but in the active process of negotiating what matters. Through discussion, critique, and iteration, we develop shared understanding that makes subjective judgments functionally objective within our context.

**Quality has discoverable objective elements.** Through collaboration, we uncover shared principles that transcend individual preference. When multiple perspectives examine the same work, patterns emerge---clarity, consistency, effectiveness---that point toward universal qualities rather than mere opinion.

**Shared goals transform subjective standards into practical tools.** When collaborators align on purpose—whether building software, writing documentation, or creating art—individual preferences crystallize into coherent criteria. The standards become "real" not because they're universally true, but because they're collectively useful.

This suggests that quality standards aren't arbitrary agreements, but rather collaborative discoveries of what works when people work together toward common ends.
