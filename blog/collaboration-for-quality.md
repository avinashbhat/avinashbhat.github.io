Quality emerges through collaboration rather than existing in isolation.

Consider what happens during a code review. A developer submits code that works perfectly from their perspective, but reviewers identify edge cases, suggest clearer variable names, and point out potential security vulnerabilities. Through this collaborative process, the code becomes better. The improvements are not arbitrary preferences, but discoveries of what makes code more maintainable, secure, and readable.

How does collaboration bring out quality? It creates it, reveals it, or formalizes it.

**Collaboration creates quality standards that did not exist before.** We develop shared understanding of what quality looks like through discussion, critique, and iteration.

**Collaboration reveals quality standards that were already there.** When multiple perspectives examine the same work, we discover patterns like clarity or consistency, that point toward universal qualities rather than mere individual opinion.

**Collaboration formalizes personal preferences into shared standards.** When we align on purpose, such as building software, writing documentation, or creating art, we crystallize individual preferences into coherent criteria. We make standards "real" not because they are universally true, but because we find them useful as a group.

Quality standards are not arbitrary. We discover what works when we work together toward common goals.
