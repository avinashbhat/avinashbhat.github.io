Quality emerges through collaboration rather than existing in isolation.

Consider what happens during a code review. A developer submits code that works perfectly from their perspective, but reviewers identify edge cases, suggest clearer variable names, and point out potential security vulnerabilities.{% include sidenote.html text="This mirrors how peer review works in academic publishing, where multiple reviewers catch issues the author couldn't see from their singular perspective. See <a href='https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06991-0' target='_blank'>Nature's guide to peer review</a> for more details." %} Through this collaborative process, the code doesn't just become "different"—it becomes demonstrably better. The improvements aren't arbitrary preferences but discoveries of what makes code more maintainable, secure, and readable.{% include sidenote.html text="This concept also applies to design reviews, where multiple designers can spot usability issues that the original designer missed." %}

While quality might seem purely subjective at first glance---what constitutes "higher quality" varies between individuals---this view oversimplifies how quality actually functions in practice.

The apparent contradiction between subjective quality and objective standards resolves when we consider three key insights:

**The collaborative process itself creates meaning.** The value lies not just in the standards we agree upon, but in the active process of negotiating what matters. Through discussion, critique, and iteration, we develop shared understanding that makes subjective judgments functionally objective within our context.

**Quality has discoverable objective elements.** Through collaboration, we uncover shared principles that transcend individual preference.{% include sidenote.html text="Think of design principles like contrast, hierarchy, and balance—discovered through collective experience rather than individual preference. For a comprehensive guide, see <a href='https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/design-principles' target='_blank'>IxDF's design principles</a>." %} When multiple perspectives examine the same work, patterns emerge---clarity, consistency, effectiveness---that point toward universal qualities rather than mere opinion.

**Shared goals transform subjective standards into practical tools.** When collaborators align on purpose—whether building software, writing documentation, or creating art—individual preferences crystallize into coherent criteria.{% include sidenote.html text="This is similar to how programming teams develop coding standards. What matters isn't that the standard is 'perfect,' but that everyone agrees to follow it consistently." %} The standards become "real" not because they're universally true, but because they're collectively useful.

This suggests that quality standards aren't arbitrary agreements, but rather collaborative discoveries of what works when people work together toward common ends.{% include sidenote.html text="For more on this topic, check out my other post about <a href='/blog/another-post'>building effective teams</a> (note: this is a test link to demonstrate internal linking)." %}
