According to Wikipedia, usability is the degree to which a software can be used by specified consumers to achieve quantified objectives with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction in a quantified context of use. For a Open Source Software, this becomes a community opinion. Since the advent of collaborative tools like GitHub which help the software development progress at a faster pace, usability of the developed tools becomes a cause of concern. This paper presents a community view by analyzing 84 survey responses.


## Abstract
The major pattern observed in the survey is that developers often adopt software-centric approach to design the product (focus on the software stack, ease of development) rather than user-centric approach. While they recognize the importance of usability, most of the developers find it difficult to consolidate and understand the community needs.


## Introduction and Background
Open Source Software development has challenges like geographically distributed communities, diverse contributor background, absense of hierarchy in members and possible asynchronous communication. This can lead to the development process becoming localised, while the software can be used globally. 

While usability is considered important, it was only treated as a *feature* of the software rather than making it the center around which the software is built. However, considering the tremendous growth of the open source world, it becomes cardinal to understand the community standpoint on the issue.

The key questions answered in the survey, paraphrasing from the paper, are

**How do OSS contributors perceive the determining factors associated with usability?** 

**What are the prominent approaches OSS contributors currently carry out to address usability issues?**

**What are the prominent barriers and difficulties they faced with respect to addressing usability?**

The survey demographics was varied between software engineers, managers, designers, software architects, data scientists and others. Their contributions were wide ranging, from feature development and code maintainance to UI design, public relation and release management.

However, researchers mention that that the demographics was only that of GitHub users. This can possibly skew the data, as any activity on this platform will be affected by the features of the platform itself. However, it goes without saying that any prominent issue that is captured on this platform can represent a non trivial subset, if not most of the issues about OSS usability.
