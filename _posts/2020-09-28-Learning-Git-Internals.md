This is a very interesting page that I came across to learn [the internals of Git](https://www.leshenko.net/p/ugit/) by implementing a Âµgit framework in Python. This tutorial is by [Nikita Leshenko](https://github.com/nikital).

Or, if you just want to use Git, [Roger Dudler](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/) nicely outlines most of the commands that you will ever use with Git.

If you think you need something more, [this GitHub page](https://github.com/git-tips/tips) has links to some Git recipes.
