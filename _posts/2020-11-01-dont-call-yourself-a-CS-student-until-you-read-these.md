The field of computer science and engineering evolves at a really fast pace, infact you will always be a *student*. That's why the title of this page is such. 

These are some amazing thought processes by really great minds that inspired me to pursue computer science. I hope you find it interesting as well! 

1. [You and your research](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html) - Richard Hamming was the inventer of Hamming Code, a simple and elegant error correcting code that is widely used. He was awarded Turing Award in 1968. A [video can be found here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1zDuOPkMSw&feature=emb_logo), if you like YouTube more.
2. [Cutting through to what matters](https://ozwrites.com/knives/) - Why you need to master basics in Computer Science, or in any discipline (with CS examples).
3. [You are not Google](https://blog.bradfieldcs.com/you-are-not-google-84912cf44afb) - How do you need to take design decisions.
4. [Teach Yourself Programming in Ten Years](http://norvig.com/21-days.html) - Why it might take longer to learn CS, and why that's okay. 
5. [The Future of Programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pTEmbeENF4) - Bret Victor is one of the people who designed the first iPad, and contributed in designing the Apple Watch. This presentation itself is unique, where Bret gives the talk assuming he is in 1973, and talks about how the programming will look like in 40 years (2013, when the talk was actually given). 
6. [Hammock Driven Development](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f84n5oFoZBc) - How to *actually* solve problems as a computer science student.


*This is a growing list, will keep updating it for as long as I can. Do check it once a year or so for updates :)*
