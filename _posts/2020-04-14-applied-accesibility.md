##### What is applied accessibility?
Web is designed for all people, irrespective of their physical capabilities. When we talk about building a free web, there has to be an inclusion of people with a varied range of hearing, movement, sight, and cognitive ability. To achieve this, the concept of accessibility was introduced to the basic building blocks of the web, HTML and CSS. 

##### How is this achieved?
W3C has a Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) which has guidelines called WAI-ARIA specifications. 
Canada has made it mandatory for people to follow accessibility by this act - [AODA](https://www.aoda.ca/).


##### Why should I learn this?
When you build a website which ignores these principles, you're denying a set of people one of their basic rights.
Also, making a business usecase, this simply allows a lot more people accessing the website, incresing the revenue.
If you're still not convined, the W3C page mentioned below has good usecases mentioned.


##### Where do I learn?
Freecodecamp has a course designed for applied accessibility, which I thoroughly enjoyed. There are 22 simple tasks which you'll be able to follow if you know basic HTML and CSS. There are background stories which tell why the particular feature in introduced.
Apart from this, you can also take a look at these listed links.
