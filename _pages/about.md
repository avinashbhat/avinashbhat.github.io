I am interested in the domain of software engineering, addressing topics like automated code reviews, building and improving developer knowledge base, software traceability among others. My motivation comes from the belief that solving software engineering problems is impactful because our world is software driven.

I work at Cisco Systems where I write code for several tools that improve development process. Based on my experience so far, I think that there is a specific software stack for every use case and I prefer to identify and work on the right set of tools for the job. Being a quick learner and having excellent search skills helps me to solve a problem quickly in a right way.

<p>I have a Bachelors degree (First Class with Distinction) in Computer Science and Engineering from <a href="https://nie.ac.in/">the National Institute of Engineering</a> from where I graduated in 2018. My capstone project was <a href="https://github.com/avinashbhat/wikicontext">evaluating a Wikipedia article for  prerequisite knowledge</a>. Thanks to <a href="https://www.streamlit.io/">Streamlit</a>, now <a href="https://share.streamlit.io/avinashbhat/wikicontext-v2/main"> there's a live demo</a>!</p>

<p>Back then I worked on recommender systems, under the guidance of <a href="https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=4goUOJsAAAAJ&hl=en">Dr. Anitha C</a>. We were able to present our research in ISCCDA 2017 and IEMIS 2018. Proceedings of the latter was published in <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-13-1498-8_8">Springer</a>.</p>

<p>Nowadays, I have been interested in Software Analysis and improving developer experience.
