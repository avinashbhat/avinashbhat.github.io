Hello! I'm Avinash. 
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
I am a Masters student at <a href="https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/">McGill University, Montreal</a>. I'm advised by <a href="https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jguo/">Professor Jin Guo</a> at the <a href="https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jguo/lab.html">McGill Software Technology lab</a>.

<p>I work at the intersection of software engineering, human-computer interaction and machine learning with a goal of improving developer experience by building tools that solve specific software engineering, collaboration and development workflow problems. My research usually leverages statistical analysis of "big" software data as well as user studies for requirement and usability analysis. Most of the work is open source and is available on my <a href="https://github.com/avinashbhat">GitHub</a>.
</p>
<p>
Previously I was a Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en_in/index.html">Cisco Systems, Bangalore</a> where I wrote code for several tools that did code reviews, deployment and overall improved software engineering processes. I was part of major enterprise software releases and maintainance releases for few projects and built multiple machine learning based proof of concepts.
</p>

<p>
I did my Bachelors degree in Computer Science and Engineering from <a href="https://nie.ac.in/">the National Institute of Engineering, Mysore</a> from where I graduated in 2018. I was fortunate to be able to write a <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-13-1498-8_8">paper</a> on recommender systems, build a cool <a href="https://share.streamlit.io/avinashbhat/wikicontext-v2/main">final project</a>, work for two very <a href="http://hexoctane.com/">early</a> <a href="https://logichive.in/">stage</a> startups, and go on several motorcyle trips.  </p>

<p>
I am an amateur flautist and also play the ukulele at times. I enjoy hiking, cooking and running (in that order). I read <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/bookshelf">fiction</a>, love fusion music (especially Carnatic, the likes of Agam and Karnatriix), watch a lot of Netflix and religiously follow Formula 1. 
</p>

<p>
Best way to reach me is through <a href="mailto:avinashbhatneelavar@gmail.com?&body=Hi Avinash! I'm contacting you through your website.">emailing</a> me. I respond to collaboration, hiring, contract (might not accept these unless they're interesting) and consulting (preferably for non-profits) proposals. Resume/CV <a href="{{site.url}}/cv">available on request</a>.
