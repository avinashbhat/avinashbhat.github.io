<p>Previously I was a Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en_in/index.html">Cisco Systems, Bangalore</a> where I worked on enterprise tools for code reviewing and deployment. My Bachelors degree was in Computer Science and Engineering from <a href="https://nie.ac.in">the National Institute of Engineering, Mysore</a>. During my undergrad, I briefly worked for two <a href="http://hexoctane.com/">early</a> <a href="https://logichive.in/">stage</a> startups, explored collaborative filtering algorithms in recommender systems, and did my final year project on contextual information retrieval for Wikipedia articles.
