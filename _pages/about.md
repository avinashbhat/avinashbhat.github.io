Hello! I'm Avinash.

I am a software developer at Cisco Systems, Bangalore. Currently, I am working on a scalable and distributed review tool based on GIT, SVN and other version control systems serving to thousands of developers at Cisco, globally.
I have coded hands on in Python, Java and related technologies required for a full stack web application development. I am trained in CI/CD principles and have experience in setting up the pipelines for the same. I have an in depth understanding of system architecture, design patterns and have experience implementing these in a cloud environment (On Premise and AWS).
I have also worked on understanding the developer productivity metrics. Working on statistical and Bayesian understanding of the same.
Previously I have worked on Recommender Systems and curious about implications of Social Networks on recommendations.


This blog contains information that I came across in my academic as well as corporate pursuits. Hoping it might help you in any way. 
If you want to know more, connect via any of the social networking platforms I've listed. Thanks! :)
