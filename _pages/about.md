I am experienced in Python, Java and related technologies required for a full stack enterprise web application development. Trained in CI/CD principles and have experience in setting up the pipelines for the same. I have an in depth understanding of system architecture, design patterns and have experience implementing these in a cloud environment (On Premise and AWS). I have proposed and worked on deploying enterprise projects in Machine Learning. 

Do contact if you want to discuss or collaborate on projects containing above technologies. I usually am <a href="https://avinashbhat.github.io/now">working on something</a>, but would accomodate if possible.

I have a Bachelors degree (First Class with Distinction) in Computer Science and Engineering from <a href="https://nie.ac.in/">the National Institute of Engineering</a> from where I graduated in 2018. My capstone project was <a href="https://github.com/avinashbhat/wikicontext">evaluating a Wikipedia article for  prerequisite knowledge</a>.
<br>
Back then I worked on recommender systems, under the guidance of <a href="https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=4goUOJsAAAAJ&hl=en">Dr. Anitha C</a>. We were able to present our research in ISCCDA 2017 and IEMIS 2018. Proceedings of the latter was published in <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-13-1498-8_8">Springer</a>.
<br> 
Nowadays, I have been interested in Software Analysis and improving developer experience. You could probably go through <a href="https://avinashbhat.github.io/2020/10/07/deepdelta">some of</a> <a href="https://avinashbhat.github.io/2020/10/04/contributor-feedback-on-usability">my</a> <a href="https://avinashbhat.github.io/2020/09/28/using-argumentation-models-to-model-issue-threads">posts</a> if you want to understand what this field entails.
