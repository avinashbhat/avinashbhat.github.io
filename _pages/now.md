The [/now page movement](https://sive.rs/nowff) was started by Derek Sivers and has [grown massively](https://nownownow.com/). 
I found it relevant, because I'm usually working on multiple things at any given time and thought that it would be helpful to people.

#### Work
 - LDAP Configurations
 - RNNs - I recently worked on a [notebook using the Stack Overflow data](https://www.kaggle.com/avinashbhat/simplernn-on-stack-overflow-data) on Kaggle. Currently studying word embeddings an code embeddings.

#### Fun Stuff
 - Since the lockdown started, I was finding some funky ways to maintain fitness - discovered jumping rope! Didn't really know that there is a [federation](https://ijru.sport/) for it either. Working on my [toad skills](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnRUwLtR33g).
