Let's see where this goes.

I'm working as a Software Engineer at Cisco Systems, Bangalore. Currently developing an intelligent system for code review serving numerous version control systems used at Cisco. Another of my extraneous stretch contribution is automating various business processes for Supply Chain Organization at Cisco. Working mainly in Java, Spring Boot and Python. In my tenure at Cisco, I have built couple of POCs and have been part of two major project teams.

I've been fortunate to work with and under the guidance of best people in the industry. Previously, I've worked with Jhenkar Dixit, CEO of HexOctane for one of his POCs involving audio fingerprinting. Prior to this I have interned at Compiler Tree Technnologies under the guidance of Prashanth Naduthota, where I explored Data Structures in depth (upto B+ trees), various Machine Learning concepts and built REST APIs for handling data streams using Apache Kafka. I also worked at RoboKraft Technologies, with Prathik Pai in a slightly different role which involved designing Go-To-Market strategies.

I have an undergraduate degree in Computer Science from National Institute of Engineering, Mysuru. This was where I found my passion in Computer Science. I was fortunate to find some really cool and erudite mentors like Alaka Ananth and Dr. Anitha C, under the guidance of whom I published my research in Recommender Systems. 

I'm an avid consumer of many tech blogs and would always love to talk about Computer Science as a subject. I keep my learning fire going with the help of MOOCs, latest of which is a Social Networks course offered by IIT Ropar through NPTEL.

In my free time I read books of diverse genres ranging from mythology to science fiction to fantasy. My favorite authors are J. K. Rowling and Dan Brown. I do read non ficton as well, few very interesting ones I've read are Sapiens and Thinking Fast and Slow. 

I love to listen to music, Carnatic, Hip-Hop and Blues Rock being my favourites. I play Kolalu (or Venu), the 8-holed flute used in Carnatic music.

This is all about me. Hit me up if you want to have a chat!
